# AI PM Learning Journey

## Why This Repository?

This is my public learning journey to becoming an AI-savvy Product Manager. As AI and LLMs transform how products are built, I'm documenting my path from fundamentals to hands-on implementation.

**Why learn in public?**
- Accountability: Committing to consistent learning and documentation
- Knowledge sharing: Helping other PMs on the same journey
- Building expertise: Writing about concepts deepens understanding
- Portfolio: Demonstrating practical AI/ML knowledge to potential collaborators

## What I'll Cover

This repository is structured as a progressive learning path, moving from foundational concepts to practical applications:

### 01-fundamentals
AI/ML basics every Product Manager should know
- What are LLMs and how do they work?
- Core concepts: tokens, embeddings, training vs inference
- Understanding model capabilities and limitations

### 02-llm-concepts
Deep dive into Large Language Models
- How prompting works and why it matters
- Context windows and memory management
- Temperature, top-p, and other parameters PMs encounter
- Fine-tuning vs prompt engineering

### 03-rag-systems
Retrieval Augmented Generation architecture
- What is RAG and why is it important?
- Vector databases and embeddings
- Chunking strategies and retrieval methods
- When to use RAG vs fine-tuning

### 04-pm-applications
How Product Managers leverage these technologies
- Product use cases for LLMs
- Building AI features: design considerations
- Evaluation metrics and quality measurement
- Cost optimization and performance tradeoffs

### 05-hands-on-projects
Actual implementations and experiments
- Building simple LLM applications
- Implementing RAG systems
- Prompt engineering experiments
- Performance comparisons and learnings

## My Approach

**Learn by doing:** Each concept will include hands-on experiments and real implementations

**Document everything:** Write as I learn, capture mistakes and insights

**Focus on PM needs:** Emphasis on what PMs need to know to build products, not deep ML theory

**Practical over theoretical:** Understanding enough to make product decisions and work with engineers

## How to Use This Repository

**If you're a PM learning AI:**
- Follow the numbered folders sequentially
- Use the templates as guides for your own learning
- Fork and adapt to your learning style

**If you're hiring AI PMs:**
- See my progression from concepts to implementation
- Review hands-on projects for practical understanding
- Assess depth of knowledge across the AI product stack
